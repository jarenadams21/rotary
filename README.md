... you shouldn't be here ...

for loop mods:

for (i = 0; i*50)

this syntax will auto handle increment or decerement by 1 depending on start and end values.

an optional rule can be provided to control index control : for (i = 0; i*50; i + 1)

notice how we pass directly the logic, no i =. a lot of interpretation for easier shorthands.
